    "\n",
    "Read this section to quickly get an idea of what the project is about.  But understand that the precise specifications in the next section must also be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Previous work: `set` and `IntegerSet`\n",
    "\n",
    "In lectures 16-18 of MCS 275, we built classes for binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and then we created a class `IntegerSet` that is similar to Python's built-in `set` type (but which has fewer features and additional restrictions on elements).  The final structure of that work was:\n",
    "* In `trees.py`:\n",
    "    * Class `Node` representing a binary tree where each node stores a `key`\n",
    "    * Class `BST` (a subclass of `Node`) representing a possibly empty BST supporting insertion and search.\n",
    "* In `integerset.py`:\n",
    "    * Class `IntegerSet` for storing an unordered collection of distinct integers, which uses a `BST` as its main data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to know anything about `Node` or `BST` to use `IntegerSet`.  The use of trees is entirely \"behind the scenes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have code that uses Python's `set` type, then you can use `IntegerSet` as a drop-in replacement as long as:\n",
    "* The only objects you store in the set are integers\n",
    "* The only methods you use of the `set` class are `add(...)` and `__contains__(...)` (through the `in` operator)\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project: `dict` and `Dictionary`\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this project you will do something similar for Python's `dict` type.**  That is, you will build a partial replacement called `Dictionary` that uses a variation on a BST for storage.  It will have fewer methods and more restrictions than Python's `dict` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, you'll have the following classes and module:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In `proj3.py`:\n",
    "    * Class `KVNode` representing a binary tree where each node stores two values: a `key` and a `value`.\n",
    "    * Class `KVBST` (a subclass of `KVNode`) representing a possibly empty BST that supports searching by `key` and various other operations.\n",
    "    * Class `Dictionary` for storing an unordered collection of key-value pairs, which uses a `KVBST` as its main data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, you will have a class `Dictionary` that would serve as a drop-in replacement for Python's `dict` in any program that:\n",
    "* Only uses dictionary keys that can be compared using `>`, `<`, and `==` (e.g. all integers, or all strings)\n",
    "* Only uses the following features of the dictionary:\n",
    "    * add new key-value pair\n",
    "    * change the value associated to a key\n",
    "    * retrieve the value associated to a key\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to creating these classes, the project specification below also asks you to write some test code for the new `Dictionary` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few things to keep in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into the details of the code you need to write, I want to emphasize a few things about the relation between this project and our previous work in the lecture examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You're writing a single module** that contains all three classes. That's different from the lecture example which was split between two modules (`trees` and `integerset`).\n",
    "1. **You can (and probably should) adapt code from `trees.py` and `integerset.py` for this project.**  Just make sure anything you adapt it is truly and fully updated, with no inaccurate comments, no parts that are irrelevant or unused, etc..\n",
    "1. **This project will not directly use or import `trees` or `integerset` modules.**  This is about making a bunch of new classes that have some similarities to the ones in those modules, but are different enough that importing is not helpful.\n",
    "1. **You shouldn't use `dict` to store any key-value pairs in this project.**  The whole point is to build a partial replacement for `dict` from scratch.  Similarly, when making `IntegerSet` we didn't use Python's `set` type.\n",
    "1. **`Dictionary` does not impose any type restrictions directly.** Unlike `IntegerSet`, this class doesn't require integer keys, and in general shouldn't do any checking of types."
