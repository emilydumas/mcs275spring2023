    "You need to design, complete, submit, and understand your own project.  You can discuss your work with other students, or even seek advice and assistance from them, or from anyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even search for ideas and answers online, and adapt code from any source that allows it, e.g. open source licensed software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, you need to carefully document your personal contribution and cite sources for everything that was not written entirely by you during this project.**  In particular you must give a detailed citation for any code you reuse or adapt, and there is a section in the documentation where you must list every person you asked for advice (with details about how their advice was used in your work) and every resource (book, web site, etc.) you consulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submitting a project that lacks proper citations or claiming another's work as your own constitutes academic misconduct and may result in a grading penalty and/or referral to the dean of students for investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do if you're stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "Talk to someone.  Email or chat with me.  Come to office hours.  Talk to your TA.  Ask another student for advice.  Search online and see if you can find open source examples that accomplish something like what you're trying to do.  (And in every case, **follow the citation guidelines** given below.)"

    "\n",
    "A lot of your grade will depend on how effectively you **document** the purpose of your project, what resources you used, and what your personal contribution was.  Expect that writing and revising the documentation is going to take a similar amount of time to actually writing code."

You can build such an application from scratch, or make it an extension of one of the examples from lecture (e.g. the big web app example we'll build this month), or a modification of an existing open source project.

If you choose to use a bunch of off-the-shelf components and textbook examples, then the same amount of effort might allow you to produce something that is more impressive at a superficial level.

    "\n",
    "**Example:** You can't get your login page to work.  You talk to your friend Greta who built something like this in IT 202 last semester.  She suggests the problem is that you using global variables for things that need to persist across multiple requests.  You didn't realize this was a problem, and the advice helps you fix the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Greta X. Oppenheimer reviewed an early prototype of the login page and helped me find and fix a troublesome bug related to the scope of local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 2: You consulted a resource like a textbook or tutorial, and things you learned there helped with your project work, but you did not copy or modify anyone else's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You read about using CSS media queries in a book.  Based on what you learned there, you made the chat application from lecture easier to use on mobile devices by editing the stylesheet.  You didn't copy any CSS code from online examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required citation:**  List the book and how it was used in the part of `README.md` titled \"Sources and credits\".  The citation should be specific enough that I can locate the book, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The media queries for mobile usability in my stylesheet were based on material from Chapter 11 of \"Modern CSS:  Master the Key Concepts of CSS for Modern Web Development\" by Joe Attardi, Apress, 2020. ISBN: 9781484262948\n",
    "> https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-6294-8_11\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 3: Part of the source code of your project was derived from existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't use someone else's code unless it is provided under a license that lets you do so, and you can't use it at all in this project if you don't understand it.  But if the license allows it, and you understand what it does, you can use it provided you give a detailed citation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You searched Stack Overflow for information about how to create a login page with Flask, because you were having trouble getting a technique you saw in the Flask tutorial to work with the rest of the application you've built.  An answer you found on Stack Overflow does what you want, and after making a few changes based on the database tables and column names you're using, you have it working as part of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**License check:** Stack Overflow answers are licensed under a Creative Commons attribution-sharealike license (CC-BY-SA) as explained at https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing, so you can incorporate a modified version of code from an answer you found there into your program as long as you cite the answer's author and apply a Creative Commons attribution-sharealike license to your program if it is ever distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required citation:** You need to list this in **two places**.  First, this use of Stack Overflow and a brief description of what it was used for should appear in `README.md` under \"Sources and credits\".  Second, the section of the source code that is adapted from that source must be labeled with comments that provide a a precise citation, including a complete URL. The citation in the source code might look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# The next function implements the /login/ route and is adapted from\n",
    "# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64717714/implement-simple-login-page-using-cookie-with-flask\n",

    "\n",
    "There's great danger here---it's easy to rely too much on the existing work and add minor things that don't amount to a significant individual contribution.  So I recommend asking me for advice on your specific plans for things to add.  But if you do compose a project this way, the project you based it on falls under \"Case 3\" above.  (Doing this without citing the other project is, of course, a major academic integrity violation.)"

    "\n",
    "You certainly don't need to base your project on anything in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authentication.** Add a proper login system to the web app we developed in lecture.  That means there is a concept of a user account, which can be of various types (corresponding to the different user roles in the app). User account information is stored in a database table separate from the main data of the application.  New views exist in the app to create an account, to log in, to log out, and to change password. A session cookie (something you'll need to learn about) is set in the user's browser upon successful login so subsequent pages they visit know they are logged in.  Other parts of the app cannot be seen unless the user is logged in.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Sounds easy, but has a ton of cases to consider and involves nontrivial database schema modification, new Flask functionality, and new HTML/CSS.  But it's a solid project idea that fits naturally into the web app example we built in class.  It's also the kind of thing you'd want experience with if seeking a software development internship that might include web programming.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web app analytics.** Add a page to the web app we developed in lecture that lets you view a visualization of the evolution of various measures of its persistent data over time.  For example, if the web app is a ticket tracker, you might make the app keep track of how long tickets are open, and the analytics page would make graphs of numbers of open tickets by week, and the average time to close a ticket by week.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Returning an image generated in Python as a HTTP response is tricky.  You'd want to look into that ASAP and either get a working prototype or ask me for htlp.  Also, you'd need to specify a way I could test this and really see interesting output.  That probably means giving me a database that already contains a bunch of analytics data.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JSON API.** We built a web app that works in the browser.  But what if you wanted to write a command line Python interface to the same application?   In that case you'd want to have a way for programs to request application data (like a list of open work orders) in a structured format, and request application-related actions (like assigning yourself to a work order).  Add an API like this that would make it possible to do anything that's possible in the browser interface directly from a Python program that communicates with the web app over HTTP.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Not much.  I think this is a good one, and for some reason people didn't choose it the last time I suggested it.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Meme maker.** A web form lets you choose a background image from a fixed collection (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Success_Kid) and enter text to draw onto the image as an amusing caption.  Upon submission of the form, Pillow (or another image manipulation library) is used to draw the requested text and provide the annotated image for the user to download.  In addition, the final captioned image then becomes an entry in a voting system, where users can give a meme a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.  Users who visit another page in the application can either browse and vote on newly created memes, or view a list of memes ranked according to score.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCS 260 Fall 2020 Project 0 autograder.** A web app offers a form with a field for entering a username, and a large text entry box where the user is expected to paste a Python script that solves the simple coding exercise described [here](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2020/fall/mcs260/project0/project0.pdf).  Upon submission, the application runs the script on the server with several inputs and checks the output against the expected results.  A report indicating the result for each test case (pass or fail) is shown to the user, and both the total score and individual test results are stored in a database.  A different page in the same application allows the instructor to view a table of scores for all users who have submitted programs.\n",
    "    * Running code submitted by a user on the web application server is very dangerous.  In a real application of this sort, you'd use some kind of \"sandbox\" to isolate the user code from the application server.  You don't need to handle any such isolation in this project, but you should know that it is important in real world applications.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Flash cards web app.**  This web application is designed to help humans memorize key-value mappings (such as the definitions of a collection of terms, or the translations of a set of words from one language to another).  The core feature is a test: The \"front\" of a card (i.e. the key) is shown and the user is asked to enter the contents of the \"back\" of the card (i.e. remember the value).  Right and wrong answers are tracked.  There is a definite probability that any card will be shown, but cards that haven't been seen are much more likely to show up, as are cards that haven't been seen too recently which have a low success rate in recent trials.  A database stores all results with timestamps, so work can resume at any time from any device able to connect and render the HTML.  A separate page within the app can be used to add or remove individual cards, reset the statistics, or clear out all existing cards.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: This is on the simpler end of projects that would be suitable for this assignment, so you would be expected to execute it both fully and well.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **What are you working on?** A web application that provides a way to share a short description of what you're working on that others can view at any time.  To post, a user visits a certain URL and enters their username and a short description of what they're doing (e.g. \"Writing the Project 4 description for my class\") into a HTML form.  After submitting the form, the application will respond to requests at a certain URL involving the username (e.g. \"/status/ddumas\") and serve a page that displays that user's most recent submission in large text.

    "1. **Event tracker.**  This application is for people who want to track how often (or for how long) they do something.  For example, it might be used to track exercise or sleep.  The main interface has a big button that a user can press to indicate either the start of an event (e.g. I'm about to start exercising) or the end of an event (e.g. I just finished exercising).  The  interface shows whether an event is currently underway, to make the current function of the button (start or stop) clear.  A database stores the event history.  Events that are started but not stopped after a certain amount of time are marked as \"incomplete\".  Using a separate configuration page, the user can indicate whether incomplete events are ignored, or if they are assigned a default duration (like 45 minutes), and how long the application waits before declaring an event incomplete.  A reporting page provides lots of information about the recent history, such as the longest event, shortest event, average event duration, average number of events per day, events per week, longest streak of days with at least one event, length of current streak, etc.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Without the logic to handle incomplete events in a user-configurable way, this application idea would probably be too simple to make a suitable project.<br><br>\n",

    "**Course staff may add new ideas to this section from time to time.  Such additions won't be listed in the revision history at the bottom of the document, since they don't change project policy.  But if an important correction is made to one of these suggestions, or if anything outside of the list of project ideas changes, that will be listed as a revision.**"
