This is the MCS 275 Spring 2023 Project 1 starter pack version 1.1.
By Emily Dumas.

Changelog:
* 2023-01-26 - v1.0 - Initial release
* 2023-01-31 - v1.1 - Fix method signatures for SupplyCache.add_material
    and DestinationCache.remove_material.  Those methods are not meant to
    be called!  The change means that error messages will be more
    informative in case these methods are called.


If you started working using an older version of the starter pack:

No problem, just replace the single file `fixtures.py` in the directory
where you're working with the updated version in this starter pack. Be
careful not to copy `shuttle.py` and overwrite the work you've done so
far! Or just work with the old `fixtures.py` if you like. If you need
help doing any of this, just ask course staff.
