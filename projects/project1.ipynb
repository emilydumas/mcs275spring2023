    "\n",
    "As you can see, deciding what operations to perform is likely to depend on an ability to check various aspects of the environment (e.g. amount of sand at each cache, capacity of each cache, monorail shuttle capacity, etc.).  There are methods for this purpose, documented below."

    "As provided, this program just makes a `Shuttle` instance, which sits at the supply forever doing nothing.  To test the behavior of the classes you write, edit this program and have it create an instance of `BackForthShuttle`, `ActOnOverflowShuttle`, or `ActOnUnderflowShuttle` instead.  The program also has comments showing where you'd put code to add new material to the supply, remove.  The autograder will test your shuttle autopilot classes with `SupplyCache` and `DestinationCache` subclasses that simulate new sand arriving and sand being used by the factory (respectively), so activating these features of `simulation.py` is a good idea."

If I see that your program does not do what was requested in this document, but the error was not detected in the automated testing, a deduction may be given at this point.
