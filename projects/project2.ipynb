    "## Playing word chiseler\n",
    "\n",
    "### The rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about the programming project, you need to learn about a puzzle game I've named \"word chiseler\".  In this one-player game, you are given a list of words such as\n",
    "> SKILLED TRAINER OF FIELD MICE\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to remove words from the list, one at a time, until no words remain.  At that point you win.  But along the way you need to follow these rules:\n",
    "1. You can only ever remove the first word or last word from the list, and\n",
    "1. If at any point the first and last words on the list don't share any letters, then the game ends and you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's try this on the example above.  Starting with\n",
    "> SKILLED TRAINER OF FIELD MICE\n",
    "\n",
    "we see the first and last words have letters in common (E and I), so we haven't lost yet!  We have a choice of removing the first word (SKILLED) or the last word (MICE).  Suppose we remove MICE.  Then we are left with\n",
    "> SKILLED TRAINER OF FIELD\n",
    "\n",
    "Here again, the first and last words have letters in common (E, I, and L), so we can keep going.  For our next move we can remove SKILLED or FIELD.  Suppose we choose FIELD.  We are left with\n",
    "> SKILLED TRAINER OF\n",
    "\n",
    "and at that point we've lost because SKILLED and OF do not have any letters in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, if we had made different choices, we could have won!**  To see this, let's start over again.\n",
    "> SKILLED TRAINER OF FIELD MICE\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove MICE.\n",
    "> SKILLED TRAINER OF FIELD\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue, since SKILLED and FIELD have letters E, I, and L in common.  Remove  SKILLED.\n",
    "> TRAINER OF FIELD\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue, since TRAINER and FIELD have letters E and I in common.  Remove TRAINER.\n",
    "> OF FIELD\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue, since OF and FIELD have letter F in common.  Remove OF.\n",
    "> FIELD\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're down to just one word, that word is both \"the first word\" and \"the last word\", and so of course it shares letters with itself.  We are therefore allowed to remove it, and we win!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sometimes you just can't win\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we play this game with starting list\n",
    "> HIRSUTE BOWL ENTHUSIAST\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a first move, since HIRSUTE and ENTHUSIAST share several letters.  But then we end up with either\n",
    "> HIRSUTE BOWL\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "> BOWL ENTHUSIAST\n",
    "\n",
    "and so in either case we've lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describing a winning strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "If you win at word chiseler, it means you removed each word that was in the original list.  The only question is the order in which they were removed.  Thus you can describe a winning strategy by listing the words in the order removed.  That *winning strategy* will contain the same words as the original list, but in a different order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the successful game\n",
    "> PERHAPS WE SHOULD BUY FOURTEEN RED ONIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "> PERHAPS WE SHOULD BUY FOURTEEN RED\n",
    "\n",
    "> WE SHOULD BUY FOURTEEN RED\n",
    "\n",
    "> SHOULD BUY FOURTEEN RED\n",
    "\n",
    "> SHOULD BUY FOURTEEN\n",
    "\n",
    "> SHOULD BUY\n",
    "\n",
    "> BUY\n",
    "\n",
    "would be described by the winning strategy\n",
    "> ONIONS, PERHAPS, WE, RED, FOURTEEN, SHOULD, BUY\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning ONIONS was removed in the first turn, followed by PERHAPS, then WE, then RED, then FOURTEEN, then SHOULD, and finally BUY.  This strategy completely specifies the gameplay, though it isn't immediately obvious that the rules of the game have been followed.  One could easily write down a list that contains all the words from the game, but in an order that breaks one of the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The name\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is called \"word chiseler\" because a chisel is a tool with a sharp edge that is used for removing bits of material from the surface of an object (often, a piece of wood) to achieve a desired shape.  Analogously, by removing words from the beginning or end of the word list, we're \"chiseling away\" at the list."
