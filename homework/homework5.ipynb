    "**As with worksheet 5, for this homework assignment you'll be asked to complete all of your work in a Python notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit everything as a single file called `mcs275hw5.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work in Jupyter (as installed with `python3 -m pip install notebook`), just name the notebook `mcs275hw5` and it will be saved with the `.ipynb` extension in the directory where you started Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work in Colab, you can download the `.ipynb` file to your computer using the menu bar that Colab displays at the top of the notebook.  Select **File**, then **Download**, and in the submenu, **Download .ipynb**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This problem score reflects notebook format\n",
    "\n",
    "When your assignment is graded, this problem's score will reflect whether your notebook follows the *notebook format* guidelines below.  The other problems contain coding exercises and the scores on those problems will look for *correctness* of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook format guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title and name at top:** Include a markdown cell at the top containing a title (top-level heading, single `#` as the formatting directive) and your name\n",
    "* **Labeled solutions:** The solution to each problem should be in a series of code and/or markdown cells, but should be labeled with a level-2 header in a markdown cell (e.g. `## Problem 3` in Markdown which renders as **Problem 3** in large bold text).\n",
    "* **No extraneous stuff:** There shouldn't be anything in the notebook other than your solutions to the problems and any explanatory text or output from the code cells that is required by the problems.  The statements of the problems shouldn't be there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advice\n",
    "1. If you want to, you can begin your work by making a copy of the notebook file used to create this assignment and editing it on your own computer.  However, if you do that, there will be a lot of stuff you need to delete before submitting.  It's not clear to me whether that's easier than starting from scratch, so do whatever you prefer.\n",
    "1. Don't submit a `.py` file, and don't just rename a Python source file from `.py` to `.ipynb`.  The way to make a `.ipynb` file is to use the Python notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Picture of expected layout\n",
    "Finally, here's a rough picture of what the notebook you submit might look like (but obviously this one doesn't contain solutions:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can put these functions in a single notebook cell or in separate cells, as you prefer.\n",

    "### Warning about big numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The number `towerfact(6)` is so astronomically large that you should not expect it to be possible to compute on your computer.  Python integers are limited in range only by available memory and time, so if you try to compute `towerfact(6)` you'll probably just end up waiting forever or exhausting your computer's memory (which would make the Python interpreter stop)."
