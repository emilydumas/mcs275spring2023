    "\n",
    "Submit all work for this problem in a file called `hwk7prob3.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you can't decide between quicksort and mergesort, so you decide to combine them into a single sorting algoritm that operates as quicksort at the top level of recursion (partitioning and calling itself on the pieces), as mergesort at the next level (cutting into pieces of equal size, recursively sorting them, then merging the results), then quick again, then merge again, all the way down.  This problem asks you to write such a \"quergesort\" function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mergesort was written as a transformation in class (returns a new list) while quicksort was written as a mutation (reorders elements of the original list), we need to decide on one of those to use throughout this new sort.  **We choose to make it a mutation, so it returns nothing and modifies the list given as an argument.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quergesort algorithm, more precisely, is:\n",
    "* Like quicksort, it accepts a list `L` and `start` and `end` indices specifying the part to operate on.\n",
    "* The function also accepts a `mode` argument with default value `\"quick\"`.  This argument controls which mode the function is currently working in.\n",
    "* In mode `\"quick\"`, the function does the following:\n",
    "    * If the list has 0 or 1 elements, returns.  Otherwise...\n",
    "    * Partitions the part of the list it's working on\n",
    "    * Calls `quergesort` with `mode=\"merge\"` on the part before the pivot\n",
    "    * Calls `quergesort` with `mode=\"merge\"` on the part after the pivot\n",
    "* In mode `\"merge\"`, the function does the following:\n",
    "    * If the list has 0 or 1 elements, returns.  Otherwise...\n",
    "    * Decides on an index that would split this part of the list into roughly equal-size parts.\n",
    "    * Calls `quergesort` with `mode=\"quick\"` to operate on the first part\n",
    "    * Calls `quergesort` with `mode=\"quick\"` to operate on the second part\n",
    "    * Uses `merge` to merge the two now-sorted parts into a new list\n",
    "    * Copies the values in the new merged, sorted list back into the part of the original list we're supposed to operate on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in mode \"quick\", the next calls use mode \"merge\", and vice versa, so the function always switches modes at the next level of recursion.\n",
