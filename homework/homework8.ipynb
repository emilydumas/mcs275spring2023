    "## Problem 2: Common ancestor\n",
    "\n",
    "If `x` and `y` are two nodes of the same binary tree (as `Node` objects), then the root node is an ancestor of both of them (or is equal to one or both of them).  So we see that any two nodes in a binary tree have a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, any two nodes have a unique *lowest common ancestor*, i.e. the node `a` that is a common ancestor of both `x` and `y`, and such that no child of `a` is an ancestor of both `x` and `y`.  Another way to describe `a` is that if you take the path in the tree that starts at `x` and ends at `y`, then `a` is the node on that path that is closest to the root.  (And it's possible that `a` might be equal to `x` or to `y`, if one of `x` and `y` is an ancestor of the other.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `lowest_common_ancestor(x,y)` that takes two `Node` objects `x` and `y` and returns their lowest common ancestor (another `Node` object).  If there is no common ancestor (i.e. if `x` and `y` lie in different trees), return `None`.\n",

    "## Problem 3: Ideal BST insert order\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary tree with $(2^n-1)$ nodes can be \"perfect\" or \"full\" in the sense that it has as many nodes as possible for its depth.  Here are some pictures of full binary trees:\n",

    "\n",
    "Write a function `ideal_insert_order(n)` that returns a list containing the integers from $1$ to $2^n-1$ (inclusive) in an order so that inserting them into a BST in that order results in a full tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `ideal_insert_order(3)` might return `[4,2,1,3,6,5,7]`.  (There are many other possible correct answers.  But for example returning `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` would be wrong:  Inserting in that order doesn't give a full tree.)\n",
