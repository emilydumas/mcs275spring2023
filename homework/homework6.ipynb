    "## Problem 2: Does the maze have a short solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like much of worksheet 6, this problem builds on the work we did in [solvemaze.py](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs275spring2023/blob/main/samplecode/recursion/solvemaze.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the length of a solution means\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our convention is that the solution to a maze is a list of `Point2` objects.  The **length** of a solution to the maze is defined as the number of objects in that list.  So if the start is at `Point2(1,1)` and the goal is at the adjacent location `Point2(1,2)`, then the list `[Point2(1,1), Point2(1,2)]` would be a solution of length 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `can_be_solved_maxlen(M,k)` that takes a `Maze` object `M`, an integer `k` and returns a boolean value:\n",
    "* `True` if maze `M` has a solution of length `k` or less.\n",
    "* `False` is returned otherwise (i.e. if `M` has no solution at all, or if all solutions to `M` have length greater than `k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be reasonable to use `depth_first_maze_solution` from `solvemaze.py` as a starting point for your work, modifying it to do what is needed in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put this function in a file called `mcs275hwk6.py` and upload it.  You don't need to upload any other files (e.g. no need to include `plane.py` or `maze.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Something to be careful about\n",
    "\n",
    "A maze might have multiple solutions.  Suppose you find a solution of length 30.  There might be another solution of length 22, and so you can't necessarily determine the return value for `can_be_solved_maxlen(M,25)` on the basis of the length of the first solution that's found."
