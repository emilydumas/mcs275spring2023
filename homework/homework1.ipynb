    "One of the exercises on worksheet 1 asked you to make a program to draw a box using unicode box-drawing characters.  A 10x5 box (width x height) of that type looks like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this problem you'll modify this program in a few ways.  First, we'll deal with a simpler version of box-drawing that doesn't involve so many unusual characters.  Instead, `+` will be used for corners and `-` or `|` will be used for edges.  The box above would be rendered this way as follows:\n",

    "|        |\n",
    "|        |\n",
    "+--------+ \n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition to changing the box-drawing symbols, for this problem you will want to think of the box drawn by the other program as a window (as you might have on the wall to look outside), to which we'll be adding a grid that subdivides that window into smaller panes.  For example, if the box above were subdivided into a 3x2 grid (horizontal count x vertical count), we'd get this:\n",

    "**Write a program called `hwk1prob2.py` that contains the following:**\n",
    "* A function `gridwindow` that accepts four integer arguments `nx`,`ny`, `xsize`, `ysize` and returns a string.  If printed to the screen, that string should look like a `nx` x `ny` grid of `xsize` x `ysize` panes.\n",
    "* A main program that calls the function `gridwindow`, using the first four command line arguments to get the function arguments (which need conversion to integers), and which prints the return value to the terminal.\n",

    "python3 hwk1prob2.py 2 5 4 3\n",
