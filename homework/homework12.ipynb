    "\n",
    "Imagine you're planning to use `todo.py` as part of a lecture demonstration.  It might not be ideal to start with an empty database, and it might also be helpful to have a way to mark every task as not completed (undone) as a sort of \"reset\" to allow you to once again show how to mark a few of them completed (done).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script `hwk12prob3.py` that expects one command line argument.  The behavior should be:\n",
    "1. If the command line argument is anything other than `reset`, `sampledata`, or `cleardone`, print an error message and exit.\n",
    "1. Open database `todo.sqlite`.\n",
    "1. If a table called `tasks` doesn't already exist, create a table with the columns `id`, `description`, `completed` as described above.\n",
    "1. If the command line argument is `reset`, delete all rows from the table `tasks`\n",
    "1. If the command line argument is `sampledata`, add 10 rows into the database with distinct descriptions.  Have all of them start out with `completed` set to `0`.  Don't set the `id` column values explicitly, so if you run this twice, 10 more rows will be added.\n",
    "1. If the command line argument if `cleardone`, set `completed` to `0` in every row\n",
    "\n",
    "This could therefore be used as a companion to `todo.py` for demonstrations, e.g.\n",
    "* Before the first demo, run `python3 hwk12prob3.py reset` and then `python3 hwk12prob3.py sampledata` so you have a known set of sample tasks (none of them done) in the database.\n",
    "* Before the next demo, reset done/undone markers with `python3 hwk12prob3.py cleardone`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The script `hwk12prob3.py` does **not** need to duplicate any features of `todo.py` and should not be written by modifying `todo.py`.  Instead, the two scripts are meant to be used together, accessing the same database but doing different things."
