One of the easiest and most flexible is to use HTML-style hex colors, in the format `\"#C0FFEE\"`.  Here, the six hex digits split into pairs to give the red, green, and blue components, which in this case are `0xC0 = 192` red, `0xFF = 255` green, and `0xEE = 238` blue.  You can use an [online color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker) to choose a color visually and see the hex codes."
