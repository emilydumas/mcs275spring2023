    "\n",
    "It has three buttons:  Up, Down, and Mode.  It keeps track of the user's desired temperature, the room temperature, and it can turn two devices on or off: a heater and an air conditioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressing `\"up\"` increases the desired temperature by one degree, unless the system is in \"off\" mode in which case it does nothing.\n",
    "Pressing `\"down\"` increases the desired temperature by one degree, unless the system is in \"off\" mode in which case it does nothing.\n",
    "Pressing `\"mode\"` button cycles between operating modes in this order: heat -> cool -> auto -> off (after which it repeats the cycle, going back to Heat).\n",
    "When the system is in Heat, Cool, or Auto mode, it shows the desired temperature on its display panel.  But in Off mode, it knows the last-set desired temperature, but does not show it anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode, desired temp, and room temp determine what the thermostat does as follows:\n",
    "* If the system is in Heat or Auto mode, the heater is turned on exactly when the room temperature is lower than the desired temperature; in any other mode, the heater is off.\n",
    "* If the system is in Cool or Auto mode, the AC is turned on exactly when the room temperature is higher than the desired temperature; in any other mode, the AC if off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a class `Thermostat` with the following attributes and methods that can be used to simulate this system:\n",
    "* `ac_is_on` - attribute, a boolean, always indicating whether the AC is turned on\n",
    "* `heat_is_on` - attribute, a boolean, always indicating whether the heater is turned on\n",
    "* `__init__(self)` - method, initializes a new thermostat in which the mode is `\"off\"`, and both the room and the desired temperature are `68`.\n",
    "* `room_temp(self,x)` - method, tells the thermostat that the room temperature is `x` and have it react accordingly.\n",
    "* `press(self,btn)` - method, simulates the press of a button; the value of `btn` should be one of `\"up\"`, `\"down\"`, or `\"mode\"`.\n",
    "* `get_display(self)` -  method, retrieves the text currently displayed on the control panel, in one of these formats:\n",
    "    * `\"72/cool\"` in cool mode (with 72 being the desired temp)\n",
    "    * `\"65/heat\"` in heat mode (with 65 being the desired temp)\n",
    "    * `\"70/auto\"` in auto mode (with 70 being the desired temp)\n",
    "    * `\"--/off\"` in off mode\n",
    "* `__str__(self)` and `__repr__(self)` - methods that return the same thing, a string in this format:\n",
