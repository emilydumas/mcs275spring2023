    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only section of the document you absolutely need to read.  The rest of the document might help you understand these rules better, but the rules themselves are just:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS1 - Header:** The first few lines of the main Python file of any assignment must be comment lines (i.e. start with `#`), and these lines must contain this information:\n",
    "    * The course (MCS 275 Spring 2023) and assignment (e.g. Homework 5 or Project 3)\n",
    "    * Your name\n",
    "    * A statement about whether you are the author of the work, and whether you followed the rules in the syllabus.  (Sometimes you will be given template code to modify and submit, in which case the expected answer is that you are the author of the changes to the provided template.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **CS2 - Docstrings:** Every function, module, and class must have a descriptive docstring (a string literal, not a comment, that is the first statement in a module, class body, or function body).  *Descriptive* means that it explains *what* the code does (without much concern for *how* it does it).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS3 - Comments:** Explanatory text is included, when appropriate, in the form of comment lines (starting with `#`) and not in any other way.  For example, including string literals with explanatory text is not acceptable unless the string literal is a docstring.  Comments are appropriate to explain *why* and *how* things are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS4 - Names:** Names of functions, variables, and classes should be descriptive and not abbreviated to the point of incomprehensibility. Iterator variables used in a short loop or comprehension are exceptions, where single character or abbreviated names are permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS5 - Indenting:** Each indented code block should be indented by the same amount relative to the surrounding code, and that amount must be at least two spaces (preferred) or one tab (discouraged).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS6 - Avoid pointless conversions:** Don’t use `str()` on something that is already a string, don't use `int()` on something that is already an integer, don’t convert a string to a list just to index it (strings already support indexing!), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS7 - Forbidden `range(len())`:** In most cases, if `range(len(...))` appears in your code, there is a preferred alternative that uses Python's iteration features in a more natural way that you must use instead.  If you think you are in one of the rare situations where `range(len(...))` should appear, ask the instructor or TA for advice before proceeding."

Using these features is not just a convenience, but a good design practice, because it allows the container to control the iteration process.  It also usually results in code that is shorter and easier to read."
