    "* Lectures can be live streamed from the Blackboard site using *Echo 360*, a lecture capture tool that uses cameras built in to our lecture rooms, and\n",
    "* Recordings of the lectures will be posted to the Blacboard site (usually later in the same day the lecture occurs)\n",
    "\n",
    "No permission is needed to attend lecture remotely using the live stream or to view a recording in place of coming to lecture.  However, students should not use these alternative means on a regular basis.  Delivery of the lectures is optimized for the in-person experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly labs are longer meetings focused on students working individually or in small groups on activities that reinforce and expand on the lecture material with the guidance and assistance of one of the course TAs.  This important practice is an essential part of the course, and is more difficult to replicate remotely.  Labs will not be live streamed or recorded, and students who will miss a lab for any reason should email their TA as soon as possible (ideally in advance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recording and grading lab attendance\n",
    "Attendance will be recorded in each weekly lab meeting, and lab attendance will account for 10% of the final grade.  The way this will be done is by assigning a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present) to you for each lab.  At the end of the semester **your two lowest lab attendance scores will be dropped**, and the remaining scores averaged.  Since there are 15 labs in total, this means that as long as you attend at least 13 of them, your lab attendance score will be 100%.\n",

This is meant to help you deal with unexpected changes in workload or available time by simply skipping an assignment.  If you use this policy to be excused from a homework assignment, it is expected that you will not submit any work on it at all.  And if you do submit work to an assignment you've been excused from, it won't count toward your grade.

    "The results of the autograder will account for most of the points available for projects 1 and 3; the exact fraction may vary from project to project.
